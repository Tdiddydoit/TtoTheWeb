        <h2>CHAPTER I NATURE AND MAN</h2> 
        <!-- contents of text -->
        <p>Man is a part of Nature, not something contrasted with Nature. His thoughts and his bodily movements 
        follow the same laws that describe the motions of stars and atoms. The physical world is large compared with Man—larger 
        than it was thought to be in Dante’s time, but not so large as it seemed a hundred years ago. Both upward and downward, 
        both in the large and in the small, science seems to be reaching limits. It is thought that the universe is of finite extent in 
        space, and that light could travel round it in a few hundred millions of years. It is thought that matter consists of electrons 
        and protons, which are of finite size, and of which there are only a finite number in the world. Probably their changes are not
        continuous, as used to be thought, but proceed by jerks, which are never smaller than a certain minimum jerk. The laws of these 
         changes can apparently be summed up in a small number of very general principles, which determine the past and the future of the 
         world when any small section of its history is known.</p>

      <p>
        Physical science is thus approaching the stage when it will be complete, and therefore uninteresting. 
        Given the laws governing the motions of electrons and protons, the rest is merely geography—a collection of particular 
        facts telling their distribution throughout some portion of the world’s history. The total number of facts of geography required to 
       determine the world’s history is probably finite; theoretically, they could all be written down in a big book to be kept at Somerset House, 
        with a calculating machine attached, which, by turning a handle, would enable the inquirer to find out the facts at other times than those recorded. 
        It is difficult to imagine anything less interesting, or more different from the passionate delights of incomplete discovery. It is like climbing a high 
        mountain and finding nothing at the top except a restaurant where they sell ginger-beer, surrounded by fog but equipped with wireless. Perhaps in the time 
        of Ahmes the multiplication-table was exciting.
